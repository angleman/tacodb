## About tacodb

tacodb is a reusable server that wraps leveldb,
tacodb/level represents a radical new approach to databases:

* A responsive database for responsive applications, core features strongly suite realtime.
* You build your own database by assembling community developed plugins, installed via [npm](https://npmjs.org).
* Since each feature is a plugin, new features are rapidly developed and integrated.
* since all features are implemented it javascript - level can be used in the _web browser_,
  with [level.js](https://github.com/maxogden/level.js)
